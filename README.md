# Births and Deaths by Country Over Time
This repo was built as a part of my master's program at the University of Missouri for my advanced data visualization class. 

The purpose of the project was to demonstrate our understanding of R Shiny by creating a small visualization that had reactive elements both in the visualization as well as the controls available to the user. I chose to look at births and deaths by country by year using data that was publically available from the UN. This visualization makes it easy to see which countries are below the rate of replacement (the rate at which births are outpacing deaths or vice versa).

The app is currently available [here](https://rshiny.dsa.missouri.edu/students/gdgp63/DATA-SCI-8654/module8-exercise1/) but will likely migrate to shinyapps.io as I doubt I'll be able to continue hosting my apps on the school's servers post-graduation.

The data was a bit messy, so data processing is done through a Jupyter notebook entitled *Data Preprocessing*.
